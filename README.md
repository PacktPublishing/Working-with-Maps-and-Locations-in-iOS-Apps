## About the Video Course
One of the wonderful parts of making apps for an iOS device is that we get to working with a GPS that is built into the phone. This tiny chip in the phone will tell you exactly where the user is in the world. What can be done with this is amazing.
More over, Apple has made this very easy for us to use. We can get a user’s exact location in latitude and longitude and show things on a map wherever we would like. To learn this new skill, we will be creating a Pokemon Go clone.
Pokemon Go is a popular iOS game that lets users catch digital Pokemon by traveling in the real world. We will be creating a simplified version of this that will teach you how to work with maps in iOS and also how to use location.
